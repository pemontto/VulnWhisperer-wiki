# FAQ

* **Is there a VulnWhisperer Dockerfile?**

The official VulnWhisperer Dockerfile is maintained at [HASecuritySolutions/docker_vulnwhisperer](https://github.com/HASecuritySolutions/docker_vulnwhisperer). This one though at the moment is outdated and the currently supported is still at [qmontal/docker_vulnwhisperer](https://github.com/qmontal/docker_vulnwhisperer)'s fork, to be merged.
